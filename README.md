## Dataset

The file `Database.xslx` contains the data our analysis is based on.

## Data Sources

### IQAir

IQAir is a Swiss company that collects air quality data and also sells equipment such as air filters, masks, and monitors. We scraped their [database](https://www.iqair.com/us/world-most-polluted-cities) of annual average PM 2.5 levels in more than 7,000 cities from 2017 to 2022.
For quality control, we also interviewed CEO Frank Hammen about their data collection and analysis process. IQAir shared with us the number of measuring stations their annual averages are based on for 2021 and 2022.

### UN Population Division

Our analysis focused on the world's biggest cities, with populations of 5 million or even 10 million people. To filter for these cities, we used population data from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs: Dataset ["Annual Population of Urban Agglomerations with 300,000 or More in 2018 (thousands)"](https://population.un.org/wup/dataquery/), projection for 2022.

### WHO Ambient Air quality database

Some complementary data for years prior to 2017 was taken from the [WHO Ambient Air Quality Database 2022](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/who-air-quality-database) when analyzing the air quality of cities in China.
